# chat-site
a chat site as a study for Armchair Therapist
I intend to create a website whose users can take one of two roles:

-provider: the provider commits to being available for chat during a certain block of time

-requester: the requester gets connected to a random provider during a block of time desired by the requester,
            and can chat with them during that block of time
